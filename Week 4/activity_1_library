# Activity 2
# Not confident with this topic, need to go through the recordings and slides once again to understand better both activities and what the question is asking.
# Understand that to create a Random number generator, we are able to get the function for this that's insalled on other Python libraries
# to use the function we must import it. random.randint is what is used to generate whole intergers
# colorama- comes from downloading more libraires using pip. Need to store locally (already done) within magic8,
# i think this is because the progamme/code we're creating, it tells that programme that it is dependant on (whatever library)
# is being used. We need to keep any libraies added within the Virtual environment, so it knows that what it needs to run properly.
# if added globally, any changed made to the library can affect our programme. The vistual environemnt keeps that safe in a folder.
